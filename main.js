Use console.log() to log the arrays.
1. Log the entire array of grocery items.
2. Log the entire array of prices.

let groceryItems = ["lettuce", "eggs", "bread", "dino nuggets", "pepsi"];
let numPrices = [4.99, 8.29, 12.79]

console.log(groceryItems)
console.log(numPrices)
console.log("chair" + ", " + "table" + ", " + "fridge")
console.log("47.89" + ", " + "53.29")
